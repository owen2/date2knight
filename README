Looks like you've already installed the package. Now go make sure that you have the right stuff in the scripts/connect.php

Now you should probably take the quiz for yourself to make sure everything is working.

Then checkout the admin page at kiosk.php. Someone should know the super secret password, it's the old name of the club.

If you can see your own results in there, everything is in order. 

You might want to change the email message's names in the markpaid.php.
